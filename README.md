## Generations

The Subaru WRX has evolved through multiple generations, each building upon its rally-inspired heritage:

- **First Generation (2000-2007)**: Originally introduced as a high-performance variant of the Impreza, the first WRX brought rally-bred performance to the streets. It featured a turbocharged 2.0L boxer engine producing 227 hp, paired with Subaru's signature symmetrical all-wheel drive system. The STI variant was introduced in 2004 with a more powerful 300 hp engine and enhanced performance features.

- **Second Generation (2008-2014)**: This generation marked a significant styling change with a wider, more aggressive design. The WRX continued with a turbocharged 2.5L boxer engine producing 265 hp, while the STI variant maintained its performance edge with 305 hp. A notable mid-generation refresh in 2011 brought wider body styling and improved handling.

- **Third Generation (2015-2021)**: For the first time, the WRX became a standalone model separate from the Impreza. It retained the 2.0L turbocharged boxer engine producing 268 hp, with significant chassis and handling improvements. The STI continued with its 2.5L engine now producing 310 hp and featuring more advanced driver controls.

- **Fourth Generation (2022-present)**: The latest generation features a complete redesign with a new 2.4L turbocharged boxer engine producing 271 hp, improved chassis rigidity, and the latest Subaru Global Platform. Notable improvements include a more refined interior, updated technology features, and enhanced safety systems. [[Subaru WRX Official Page]](https://www.subaru.com/vehicles/wrx)
